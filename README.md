## 🚀 Project Overview

**MindBreaks** is an AI-powered application that delivers short, creative, and personalized microbreaks designed to reduce burnout, boost creativity, and promote emotional wellness at work. It uses mood detection, intelligent recommendations, and gamification to make breaks more meaningful—especially in remote and hybrid work environments.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced work culture:

- People often skip breaks or take passive ones (scrolling, zoning out).
- This leads to burnout, mental fatigue, and reduced creativity.
- There is a lack of structured, intentional ways to refresh minds.

## 💡 Solution

MindBreaks offers:

- AI-curated 5-minute breaks tailored to mood and energy level.
- Engaging activities like riddles, doodles, trivia, stretches, and mini-games.
- Mood tracking and progress analytics to visualize mental wellness.
